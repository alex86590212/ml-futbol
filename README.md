## Overview
**RL-Tactics** helps coaching staffs answer the question ‚û°Ô∏è *‚ÄúWhat is the best way to line up and press against Team X next Saturday?‚Äù*  
It does so by training a **reinforcement-learning (RL)** agent in a simulation environment and surfacing match-specific tactical plans ranked by expected goal differential (**xGD**).
