## Overview
**RL-Tactics** helps coaching staffs answer the question ➡️ *“What is the best way to line up and press against Team X next Saturday?”*  
It does so by training a **reinforcement-learning (RL)** agent in a simulation environment and surfacing match-specific tactical plans ranked by expected goal differential (**xGD**).
---

## Roadmap
- **Version 0 (current)** — we’re at **v0**; core research sandbox with continuous improvements underway.  
- **Version 0.1** — first prototype of the RL model that can generate basic tactic recommendations.  
- **Version 1.0** — final public release with refined model, full documentation, and a polished web interface.
