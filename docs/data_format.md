# Data Format

This document describes the structure and meaning of the CSV tracking files generated by ML-Futbol. These files are useful for downstream analysis, plotting, or feeding into external ML models.

## Output Directory
All tracking CSV files are stored in:

```
frames_player_ball/
├── player_coordinates.csv
├── player_visibility.csv
├── ball_visibility.csv
```

## 1️. `player_coordinates.csv`

### Columns:
- `frame_idx`: Frame number in the video
- `tracker_id`: Unique ID assigned to each player by the tracker
- `x`, `y`: Coordinates of the player (pixel or pitch-transformed)
- `team_id`: 0 or 1 — assigned by the `TeamClassifier`

### Purpose:
- Analyze player movement, spacing, or positioning
- Used in tactical visualizations and heatmaps

## 2️. `player_visibility.csv`

### Format:
- Each **row** represents a frame
- First column: `frame_idx`
- All other columns: One per `tracker_id` (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5...)
- Values: `True` or `False` — whether that player was visible in that frame

### Purpose:
- Track occlusion or dropout in detection
- Useful for quality checks and dropout recovery

## 3️. `ball_visibility.csv`

### Columns:
- `frame_idx`: Frame number in the video
- `ball_visible`: Boolean — whether the ball was visible in the current frame

### Purpose:
- Trigger interpolation for missing frames (Kalman, etc.)
- Assess tracking quality or ball possession continuity
