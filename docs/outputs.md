# ðŸ“¤ ML-Futbol Output Files

This document explains the contents and purpose of the annotated videos and CSV tracking files generated by ML-Futbol.

## Annotated Videos

All annotated video files are saved in the `saved_images/` directory.

### `anottated_player_video.mp4`
- Shows detected players, goalkeepers, and referees
- Each individual is annotated with:
  - Ellipses around their location
  - Player ID number
  - Team label (classified by TeamClassifier)

### `anotatted_pitch_video.mp4`
- Shows the original video with pitch geometry overlaid
- Includes detected keypoints such as:
  - Center circle
  - Penalty boxes
  - Corners
- Used to establish a homography and visualize a tactical grid

### `ball_video_detection.mp4`
- Displays the detected ball
- Annotated with a triangle shape
- Useful for analyzing passes and ball possession

### `kalman.mp4`
- Shows smoothed object trajectories (players or ball)
- Generated using a Kalman filter to reduce jitter and fill gaps

### `track_ball_video.mp4`
- Displays a complete ball tracking visualization
- Includes interpolation for missing frames when the ball isn't visible

## CSV Tracking Files

These are stored in the `frames_player_ball/` directory and contain structured tracking data.

### `player_coordinates.csv`
- Columns: `frame_idx`, `tracker_id`, `x`, `y`, `team_id`
- Represents the 2D field position of each player per frame
- Used for statistical analysis and heatmap generation

### `player_visibility.csv`
- Wide-format frame-by-player table
- Rows: frames; Columns: tracker IDs (player IDs)
- Values: `True` or `False` â€” whether the player was visible

### `ball_visibility.csv`
- Columns: `frame_idx`, `ball_visible`
- Indicates whether the ball was detected in each frame
